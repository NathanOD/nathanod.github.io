I'm a second-year master's student at Polytechnique MontrÃ©al, specializing in multimodal RGB-Depth image segmentation and 3D reconstruction for industrial applications. My research focuses on developing advanced computer vision techniques to enhance worker safety through accurate, real-time monitoring in collaborative environments involving both humans and robots.

More broadly, my research interests span computer vision and natural language processing, with a particular focus on effectively combining these two modalities while maintaining the richness of visual information.

Back when I was living in France, I interned with the SYD Group, where I worked on customer request classification, as well as satisfaction and emotion analysis, to improve customer care in contact centers. This involved fine-tuning large language models and leveraging retrieval-augmented generation techniques.

During my engineering studies in France, I also conducted research on object detection and tracking in videos captured by fisheye cameras. This early and unique experience sparked my passion for computer vision and deepened my interest in the research process.
