I'm a second-year master's student at Polytechnique MontrÃ©al, specializing in multimodal RGB-D image segmentation and 3D reconstruction for industrial applications. My research focuses on developing advanced computer vision techniques to enhance worker safety through accurate, real-time monitoring in collaborative environments involving both humans and robots.

More broadly, my research interests lie in computer vision and natural language processing, with a particular focus on effectively combining these two modalities while preserving the integrity of the visual information.
