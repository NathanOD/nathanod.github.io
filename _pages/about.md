I'm a graduating master's student at Polytechnique MontrÃ©al, specializing in multimodal RGB-Depth image segmentation and 3D reconstruction for industrial applications. My research focuses on developing advanced computer vision techniques for segmenting objects that appear separated in images, enabling accurate monitoring to enhance worker safety in collaborative environments involving both humans and robots.

More broadly, my research interests lie in fine-grained vision-language comprehension, with a particular focus on spatial relation reasoning. I am interested in how language and visual information can be jointly leveraged to interpret and model detailed spatial relationships between objects, in order to preserve and utilize the richness of visual information.

Back when I was living in France, I interned on a project focused on enhancing customer care in contact centers through customer request classification, as well as satisfaction and emotion analysis. My work involved fine-tuning large language models and applying retrieval-augmented generation techniques.

During my engineering studies in France, I also conducted research on object detection and tracking in videos captured by fisheye cameras. This early and unique experience sparked my passion for computer vision and deepened my interest in the research process.

When I'm not working on my research, I'm a big football fan, especially of the Stade Rennais, and I love basketball too, supporting the Lakers. I enjoy watching and playing both sports in my free time.
